# ThermodynamicsForProgrammers
A small project for documenting the minimum knowledge, which is needed for a programmer to understand the thermodynamic models used within the industry

The documentation is written in Lyx, and the compiler used in my setup is TexLive, but it should work with most tex compilers.

The source code examples, (if I get around to making any) are all kindly sourced from Sabroe Factory by Johnson Controls, with their permission.

Enjoy the contents
